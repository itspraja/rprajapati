I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering and a Master's degree in Data Engineering. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at [IIT Jodhpur](https://iitj.ac.in/), focusing on **High-Performance Computing, Graph Analytics, Stream Analytics, and Knowledge Graphs**.

My foundation in algorithms and data structures led to a focus on distributed systems, databases, and information retrieval during my Master's. My thesis, **Semantic PageRank** and project, **Recommender System Using Knowledge Graphs** (details in project section), reflect my interest in knowledge graphs and their applications. I'm driven to apply these skills to solve real-world problems.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and continuously expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of computer science. I am also a Zettelkasten enthusiast.
